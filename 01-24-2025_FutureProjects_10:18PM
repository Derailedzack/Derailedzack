- 1. A SDL2 and OpenGL template
- 2. A test rom and firmware for the OSDevEmulator
- 3. Port the DevScreen to SDL 1.2 for older platforms that don't support SDL2
- 4. Port the DevScreen to SDL3
- 5. Create a lua port of the OSDevEmulator
- 6. A remote appication for interfacing with opencomputers or computercraft using TCP or websockets (Websockets will be for the computercraft version if I ever write that as CC:Tweaked only provides websockets not plain old TCP. So that will be fun to deal with)
